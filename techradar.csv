angular,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,<p>Angular is a full-featured, open-sourced, front-ended, Typescript based web application framework. It is widely used for building single-page front-ended applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular facilitates modularized code that is less complex to be developed, tested and maintained. Some times it is also mentioned as Angular 2+. Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS which is Javascript based and therefore the two should not be confused. Nevertheless, Typescript is a superset of Javascript and therefore already developed applications in Javascript are compatible with Typescript.</p>
